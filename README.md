# DevOps Revolution: Amplify Deployment Across AWS Accounts Using AWS CDK for Seamless Integration

The article focuses on the following characteristics: We will build a strategy to have CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous delivery) for our developer teams with an efficient life cycle, focused on application-making with a paradigm over Serverless and Cloud-Native.

In my five years of experience working with Serverless Applications, I have often used “Serverless Frameworks” such as IAC tools. But in recent years, I have had a great challenge migrating from “Serverless Framework” to “CDK” using the same paradigm.

It was a fantastic outcome because the switch was transparent to the teams; it is a fact that the way the team declared the resources changed, but at the end of the day, it is natural to developer teams instead of declaring resources now writing them.

The following workflow gives you a big picture of what we will build through walking this article.
